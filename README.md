### JUST SO YOU KNOW

I haven't tested it on Linux yet as I don't have a linux machine avalible, but I *DID* write it so hopefully it works on all three main Operating Systems (Windows [my test machine], Mac, and Linux.)

This is made for the people who never use mpv via terminal and perfer the pseudo-GUI.
