# mpvHotswap
A lua script for MPV that closes the previous instance(s) automatically.

This does NOT use a socket, I tried to write it specifically to avoid that...

... Mostly because I don't know how they work and I was scared of it :(

# - How to use - 
Go to where your mpv scripts are stored.

> For Windows:
`C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Roaming\mpv\scripts`

> For Linux:
`~/.config/mpv/scripts`

Place lua file there, profit & prosper.

### JUST SO YOU KNOW

This has yet to be tested on Mac (Windows 10 and Linux [at least with openSuse] is confirmed to work.)

This is made for the people who never use mpv via terminal and perfer the pseudo-GUI.
